        <h1>Beyond the Towpath</h1>
        <p>
          The London Canal Museum | 2 June – 2 August 2015

        </p><p>
          In 2015 Telegram Gallery was invited to hold an exhibition at the London Canal Museum. As a result Alberta Bamonte made a new series of work under the title Beyond the Towpath, inspired by London’s Regent's Canal.

        </p><p>
          Alberta’s works approached the canal and the surrounding areas from an aerial perspective. She used satellite views to focus in on a section of the water, the towpath and beyond, before reproducing the scene on paper or burlap, adapting the colours and shapes to create a unique kind of landscape where the industrial and the natural sit side by side.

        <h1>Lynda Laird: Urban Beekeeping</h1>
        <p>
          Peckham Pelican | 2–8 March 2015
        </p><p>
          As part of a year-long residency at the Peckham Pelican, Telegram Gallery held an exhibition of photographs by Lynda Laird entitled Urban Beekeeping.
        </p><p>
          The honey bee population has declined massively in recent years due to the rise of GM crops, habitat degradation and the use of pesticides.  Bees pollinate over 30% of our food and 90% of our wild plants; without bees to spread seeds, many plants, including food crops, would die out.
        </p><p>
          In response to the bee crisis, there has been a huge increase in the number of people taking up bee keeping, especially in cities. Urban Beekeeping follows the work of Camilla Goddard, a full time beekeeper for Capital Bee in South London. She first started keeping bees eight years ago and now has hives all over the city: in parks, churchyards, primary schools and on the roofs of hotels.

        </p><p>
          As part of a year-long residency at the Peckham Pelican, Telegram Gallery held an exhibition of large format photographs by Hayley Nia Thomas entitled Seascapes. The works capture the wild west coast of Ireland in Thomas's classic muted style; sea and sky merge in a grey haze while cliffs and crags become abstract extractions of negative shape.

        <p>
          London Review of Books | 8 May – 2 June

        </p><p>
          As part of a two month long residency at the London Review of Books' cafe and shop, Telegram Gallery presented an exhibition of photographs by Hayley Nia Thomas. London Fog sees Thomas taking her home turf as her subject, depicting Deptford and Greenwich as otherworldly places, cloaked in fog, with their iconic architecture cropped almost to obscurity.

        <p>
          London Review of Books | 3 April – 6 May 2014
        </p><p>
          'I wouldn't say I draw landscapes. My pictures do not invite the viewer to enter the space like traditional landscapes do. There is a greater, insurmountable distance in a satellite picture—rather than a window, it resembles a glass floor.

        </p><p>
          The aerial perspective turns ports from busy, inaccessible non-places into peaceful motherboards. We can ignore danger, noise and exploitation. When all we see are pleasing colours laid out in neat rows, we forget global marketplaces and focus on pattern instead.'
