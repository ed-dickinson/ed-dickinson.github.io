        This music is my gift to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an attempt to trace my experience, and from that give to you what I can, in the hope that it mirrors something in you and your experience. I hope you come away a little bit more connected to me, and maybe even to the whole of everything.

      <h3>Living Yourself</h3>

      <p>
        '<a href='/living-yourself'>Living Yourself</a>' was an album I made in 2020, after a period of life where my soul was particularly unmoored, seeking out happiness wherever it could be found. I'd had a lot fun experiences on my travels, and this album is as close to a document of that as I could make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music has a simple grounding, mostly guitar and vocals, that have then been stretched and sculpted into an orchestra of manipulated electronic sounds that serve as an extension of the emotional content.

      <h3>Crumbs of Heaven</h3>
      <img src="../public/assets/heaven-cd.jpg" class="album-art" />
      <p>
        I made '<a href="https://crumbdouglas.bandcamp.com/album/crumbs-of-heaven">Crumbs of Heaven</a>' in 2018. In retrospect it was during a time of regression and healing, and the album was either representative of escaping into a somewhat false fantasy of happiness; or of an actual finding of happiness wherever it could be gleaned during a time of deep and confusing grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music is simple and unmanipulated, consisting of my voice, my grandad's old guitar, a bass, a flute, and a few different FM keyboards. During recording I liked to think of the instrumental embellishments as 'painting upon the canvas of the song'.
