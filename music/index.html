        This music is my gift to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an attempt to trace my experience, and from that give to you what I can, in the hope that it mirrors something in you and your experience. I hope you come away a little bit more connected to me, and maybe even, in my own small way, to the whole of everything.

      <h3>Songs of Myself</h3>

      <p>
        My life's work. This is an album that will change and grow with me, as I add new songs, change old ones, and prune the ones that no longer represent me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to make a fresh start in my Jesus year, be done with the pseudonym's I'd hidden behind before, and make music that felt like it honestly came from who I am as a person. As I figure the more honest I can be with music, the more meaningful it can be to whoever listens to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't want to have to make a whole new album to present new music, as this inevitably requires including songs that aren't quite your best, but a single song seems insignificant and lonely. So I thought I could have one album that I added to as I wrote new songs, and represented the best of my ability. I was inspired by my endless, majestic hero Walt Whitman, who kept adding to his poetic opus 'Leaves of Grass' for as long as he lived.

      <h3>Rural Loaf</h3>

      <p>
        '<a href='/rural-loaf'>Rural Loaf</a>' was an album I made in 2020, after a period of life where my soul was particularly unmoored, seeking out happiness wherever it could be found. I had a great time loafing around in the rural backwaters of Britain and New Zealand, and this album is as close to a faithful document of that time as I could make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music has a simple grounding, mostly guitar and vocals, that have then been stretched and sculpted into an orchestra of manipulated electronic sounds that serve as an extension of the emotional content.

      <h3>Crumbs of Heaven</h3>
      <img src="../public/assets/heaven-cd.jpg" class="album-art" width="600" height="600" alt="A photo of a CD in the grass. The cover depicts a contorted drawn figure, with flowers coming out the top of his head." />
      <p>
        I made '<a href="https://crumbdouglas.bandcamp.com/album/crumbs-of-heaven">Crumbs of Heaven</a>' in 2018. In retrospect it was during a time of regression and healing, and the album was either representative of escaping into a somewhat false fantasy of happiness; or of an actual finding of happiness, wherever it could be gleaned during a time of deep and confusing grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music is simple and unmanipulated, consisting of my voice, my grandad's old guitar, a bass, a flute, and a few different FM keyboards. During recording I liked to think of the instrumental embellishments as 'painting upon the canvas of the song'.
