    <h3>Javascript Dev.<br />& Web Enthusiast</h3>

      Hello!

      I'm currently looking for a development role, front-end, back-end or full-stack‚Äî something that has a positive impact on people's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about people's health and wellbeing, and how that affects‚Äì and is affected by their surroundings, communities and lifestyles. I'm concerned with the result of technology on our mental health, but I also know there's huge positive's to be had. I'm particularly interested in the ways traditional practices and ways of living intertwine with modern ones, and how they can benefit each other.

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <div class="abilities">

      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/javascript-rnd.png' name='Javascript'/>
        <strong>Javascript</strong> is where my heart and my focus lies. I spend most of my time using either JS frameworks for their flexibility and speed of use, or vanilla javascript, for the playfulness, customisation and specificity, and the simple pleasure of building something from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/react.png' name='React'/>
        I value <strong>React</strong> as a tool for it's speed of website creation and it's endlessly amazing ability to display lots of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/nodejs.png' name='node.js'/>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/express.png' name='Express JS'/>
        Being as fond as I am of Javascript, I cherish the ability to program the back-end and front-end in the same language, for the consistent mindset it enables and the architectural unity. So I use <strong>node.js</strong> and <strong>express</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><img src='../public/assets/logos/html.png' name='HTML'/>
          <!-- <span style='top: -0.5em; position: relative; left: -0.05em;'>&</span> -->
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/css.png' name='CSS'/></span>
        What would any website be without <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>CSS</strong> the bread and butter of the front-end? I use it with the respect it deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/mongoleaf.png' name='MongoDB'/>
        I won't lie: I don't know much about relational databases, but I do know that I know I like non-realtional ones for their flexibility and adaptability. And <strong>MongoDB</strong>'s the one I know.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/aws.png' name='AWS'/>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/heroku.png' name='Heroku'/>
        I favor Heroku for it's simplicity in hosting an API, but I also use AWS, especially for Elastic Beanstalk's rapid hosting.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/netlify.png' name='Netlify'/>
        I'm a big fan of the JAM stack, and I think the split architure gives way to incredible versatility, cross-usability and re-usability.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/git.png' name='Git'/>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/github.png' name='GitHub'/>
        I'm a compulsive saver and versioner, so <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> are indispensible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/wordpress.png' name='Wordpress'/>
        I'm no <strong>Wordpress</strong> master, but I know my way around it, and find it a good way to give customer's a blog-based website, as a bespoke CMS takes <em>time</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/java.png' name='Java'/>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/csharp.png' name='C#'/>
        <img src='../public/assets/logos/python.png' name='Python'/>
        I also have some basic experience in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
      </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project" for='jog-log'>
      <h3>Jog Log <a class='go-there' href='https://jog-log.netlify.app'>LINK</a></h3>

      <div class="screenshot">

        <img class="screenshot" src='../public/assets/gifs/jog-log400.gif' />
      </div>

      <p>
        I made a web-app called <em>Jog Log</em> that would log personal running activity because, for a few reasons, I was tired of using Strava to track my runs, so I made a personal replacement that suited my needs better.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the front-end I used the React framework, and the back-end is a REST API üåê served by Node.js, utilising express. it features user creation and verification, as well as run & shoe creation.

    <div class="project" for='tumbleword'>

        <img class="screenshot" src='../public/assets/gifs/tumbleword400.gif' />
      </div>

      <p>
        <em>Tumbleword</em> is a game inspired by the recent <em>Wordle</em> craze and the cultural mainstay <em>Tetris</em>. You place falling letters to find a 5-letter word pre-selected by the computer. The speed increases as you successfully find words and clear previous letters. There is a leaderboard impemented that logs the 10 highest scores across all users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front-end is made with vanilla JS, and the leaderboard is an API üåê served by Node.js and express.

        <img class="screenshot" src='../public/assets/gifs/multi-mask2-400.gif' />
      </div>

      <p>
        <em>Multi Mask</em>, a small web-app that lets you make your own pixellated mask on a basic editor, then add it to the collection of masks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The back-end is an API üåê served by Node.js and made with express.js. It includes a user storage and log-in as well ask saving all the masksd. The front end, including the editor is made with vanilla javascript. üç¶

        <img class="screenshot" src='../public/assets/gifs/livin-urself11*.gif' />
      </div>
      <p>A music player made with vanilla Javascript üç¶ for listening to an album I made in 2021, during the first lockdown, called <em>Living Yourself</em>. üé∂</p>
      <p>
        I made a custom tracklist player and control bar for HTML5's native audio player. There is a mobile version of the site with a different layout, but sadly it's limited by the fact that the player will not auto-play the next track if the browser is not currently open.
