      <span class="fancy-capital" style="top: -0.5em;">H</span>ello, I'm a code cobbler who plys his trade from the sun-splashed realm of Glasgow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strive to use web technology to connect human experience in new and delightful ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm freelance ‚Äì a web-hand for hire ‚Äì so if you'd like a custom, handmade website, or just have some general programming that needs doing, then don't be shy.

    <p>
      <span class="fancy-capital" style="width: 1.5rem;">I</span> work primarily with Javascript, favouring vanilla JS for it's playfullness and creativity, but using the React framework for front-end flexibility and speed of use, and node with express on the back-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tend to use MongoDB for a database and either AWS or Heroku for hosting, and Git with GitHub for versioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm happy to create a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) from scratch, but I also know my way around Wordpress master, and find it to be a good way of providing a client with a blog-based website, as a bespoke CMS takes time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have some basic experience in Java, C# and Python.

              <p>
                I made a web-app called <em>Jog Log</em> that would log personal running activity because, for a few reasons, I was tired of using Strava to track my runs. So I experimented with the idea of an alternative that would encourage the more poetic, and reflective side of running. To focus more on thoughts & feelings than data & tracking.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the front-end I used the React framework, and the back-end is a REST API üåê served by Node.js, utilising express. It features user creation and verification, as well as run & shoe creation.

              <p>
                <i>Tumbleword</i> is a web game I made that combines elements of <i>Tetris</i> and <i>Wordle</i>. You place falling letters to find a 5-letter word pre-selected by the computer. The speed increases as you successfully find words and clear previous letters. There is a leaderboard impemented that logs the 10 highest scores across all users.
              </p>
              <p>
                The front-end is made with vanilla JS, and the leaderboard is an API üåê served by Node.js and express.js.

                The player itself allows skipping through the track via clicking in the play bar. There is also a lyric box that changes with the track.
