Re-recorded for it, to bring them into the fold and free them from their past housing. The main condition for them to be carried forward was that they could stand alone as poems without music. And I think for the most part they do.","date":"2020"},{"era":1,"songlist":["wear_life","sunfruit","thankful","full_moon","bugs","wild_animal","new_place","happiness","hornlight"],"blurb":"This was a set of songs I wrote that I felt were connected in feel and content, but I wasn't sure if they had enough 'closeness' to warrant an album together. I also felt torn between just wanting to write songs and let them stand on their own, to not have to be part of some bigger entity. But at the same time they naturally a part of a bigger entity: my whole body of work. \n\nSo I used this as away to represent that. They are part of something bigger, but also they exist on their own, and can evolve, and aren't constrained to the context of an 'album'.\n\nDuring this time I was transfixed by the idea of this 'thing' that lies just beyond the scope of our experience, the thing that lets us see beauty and magic where objectively there is only a flower or a tree. In the Medieval Era they called it God, in the 18th centry they thought it was fairys, maybe now we just call it the human soul. I couldn't help but by be drawn by the idea of this 'essence' lying just beyond the realm of oursenses. But close enough to feel it. And we most invoke something to dull the pain of the incomprehensible.","date":"2023"},{"era":2,"songlist":["test"]},{"era":3,"songlist":["test"]}]
