      <div class="title">autumn classic</div>

      <div class="body">
running with my hands full of apples,
i know my muscles are made of Chiltern clay.

when i take my shoes off and enter the village church,
and feel my bare feet on the carpeted aisle,
it reminds me of the delicate orange floor——
the woods' sprawling orange chapel
that makes sure i know it is a living thing,
as i run the length of it's corridors,
it's little creatures taking to the skies
                            and up the trunks of trees.

when i reach the high points, and look out across it's roof,
i see a hundred tiles, in all manner of auburn,
and i know autumn is burning with a dry and biding heat,
waiting for us all.

    <div class="title">fog-ghost</div>
    <div class="body">
sheep appear like sentient fog spawn,
a fog so heavy the trees are dripping with it.
drops fall on my skin and let me know i'm here,
not adrift in the thick folds, like all else around me.

    <div class="title">interrupting birds</div>
    <div class="body">
i scare birds i don't know the names of
and they take flight — scaring leaves
from trees they don't know the names of.

black wings sworl and orange darts flutter
free to match the thoughts loosed from my head
an emptiness that knows the silent name of nothing.

    <div class="title">theatre of the sky</div>
    <div class="body">
the ocean claws back at the land,
beckoned by the sky above it,
a wild seriousness in it's mind.

soon the sun will win out as it always does,
and return us to the eternal summering of the world,
where each blade of grass seizes upon a glint of sunlight,
feasting on it's reflected peace,
and all that graveness threatened,
is but a light-hearted play.

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="title">church hunter</div>
    <div class="body">
god sleeps in the church ruins of St. Giles,
where my skin is a filth of mud and sweat,
yet the stone recognises pureness underneath.

'god is love' etched above the door at St. Gabriels,
a love quiet—— but still audible,
in whispers underneath the thoughtless roar of the A-road.

St. Candida heals my eyes by simply looking on her shrine,
i no longer see past the flaws,
of the world—— i see not flaws.

    <div class="title">guppy</div>
    <div class="body">
the sun sets to work unveiling the world,
stripping the mist to reveal a giant apple,
gentle folds down the valley, that lead to the stalk.
soft fur with a dew coat,
my feet sweep it clean,
pick up the dew, i am becoming the apple.
pick up the smaller apples and put them to my mouth,
——i become the apple.

the church is closed to me,
the apple tree will have to do.

    <div class="title">ridge sails</div>
    <div class="body">
my body lightens,
floating down the ridgeline,

my mind takes leave of me,
light on the wind,

spores aloft above the valley,
of my inner landscape,

settle where it will,
take root on the lung,

breathe the light,
and catch the air.

    <div class="title">striations</div>
    <div class="body">
the light sits scattered through the trees,
sliced to pieces by my strafing vision.

it hangs floating in the mist over the wier,
distracted—
                  set loose from it's intention.

like each smile sent out into the world,
was born of a decision, for which i am grateful,
as it doesn't always know where it will land.

but will surely lie waiting,
if it finds no one to receive it right away.

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="title">roman rodeo</div>
    <div class="body">
how long has this path cut through these trees?
superhighway of the soul,
expressway of the earth.

did romans really march here?
where now are people walking dogs,
and me running as fast as i can,
trying to summon something older
and something deeper than myself.

i meet a dog who looks as old as that,
leakage matts the fur beneath his eyes,
that look as if they're barely holding in there,
as he lumbers at me, slow as timber,
a living tree with in it's mind to smell me.

there is a pearl at the heart of road running,

my body and my mind cast aside.

3 heralds on a hilltop

    <div class="title">moon bird</div>
    <div class="body">
in the early evening
it was the sky
caught between a halycon orange
and a vespering blue

and the birds singing
a town of joyous villagers
awoken to the false news
of the suns bountiful harvest

that made me think
i could strip off my clothes
and bathe in the glow
of the full moon

until my own breath
in curdled crisps upon my beard
made me realise
the warmth was in my motion

and not the stillness of the moon
that gives no warmth
a recalcitrant king of shopfront neon
cold, and un-nourishing

so ignorant of my wonder
so callous to my reverence
and still...
	i'm a sucker for the glow

    <div class="title">length of nights</div>
    <div class="body">
did i run past a witch of the modern night?
who holds a phone close to her face,
her connection to the ether,
erupting in a cackle, as a
winding breath of steam crawls from the
building above her,
and snakes into the sky.

and to the moon,
who is out in full force,
with it's underlings the icy stars,
and low-hanging clouds that lurk,
reflected in the speckled ground,
sparkling with crystals,
rapt in the path of two red eyes
lit up behind a fog blanketed street,
as bright as tail-lights turned toward me,
slowly approaching,
snarling,
and breathing hot exhaust fumes.

when spring comes
                      —— i shall empty myself and escape,

    <div class="body">
i went by the derelict shopping precinct
as it was being worked upon by the machines of demolition.
slowly torn to rubble by a scrupulous metal claw.

i'd always harbored a faint attachment to the building,
the grass growing out the roof,
graffiti decorating the courtyard walls.

many times i'd walked in it's pebbledash palms and felt
there was still growth in it.
maybe some benevolent regeneration lay in it's future yet.

but no.   and on i go.
to forget about it eventually.
when it's no longer there to remind me of itself.

    <div class="body">
so much time spent jumping between my two legs
seeking something in that weightless gap——
the magic twilight in the moment between night and day
the actual human that lies between angel and devil
the act that connects the creature and creator.
and for that moment i am lifted——
hanging halfway between the earth and the skies,
where i have a fair and even view to see them both——
i can catch a glimpse of truth.

the morning is fresh,
and steam rises around me,
from my hunched body,

crouched in a tree-clearing,
to inspect a ring of pearly trumpets,
mushrooms sprouting,
from a carpet of leaves.

they sound silent peals,
that prick the ears of my animal self,

a song of the deep earth,
that longs to be eaten.

i pluck them, and feel the pop
of satisfaction,
as they're loosed from the ground,
to experience life on legs.

there's nothing quite like the feeling
of getting to run—— <i>really run</i>
after hobbling along the trails for so long.

like your legs and arms are bone handles,
inflating the billows of your lungs,
cranking you—— floating you on,
in search of something you can only find
in the particular act of moving in this way.

when you're up to this speed
where you feel like you could run forever,
like you've fallen into step with the world itself.

i must thank whatever force has healed me,
soothed the gremlin that took up residence
in my calf, so many months ago.
though i still feel it in there,
i can run long and far again,
it's ill intent now lifted.

it lets me feel it's possible
for every jaunt out in the world
to feel somehow better than the last?
whatever's with me now, powering me
on this ever-upwards trajectory,
i'm immensely grateful for it.

the world looked as beautiful today as i felt within,
the air still as cows, 'til they were running with me.
footways winding through trees and open grass,
caught right in the sweet spot of autumn——
oranges, yellows, greens, on the same tree,
on the same leaf even.

I wrote the main part of this collection of poems over the winter of '22/'23, a time when I was hungry for meaning, looking for it wherever I could.
<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Because of that, I spent a lot of time out running, for it takes me to a place mentally and spiritually where I feel close to whatever it is that makes meaning. Close to whatever made me, where my senses alive and most succeptible to having things imparted on them.
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It also lets me see a lot of the land I love. Fields, trees, skies, and hills, gathering under my bounding footsteps. A bounty to be imprinted on my hungry little brain.
